          I'm Gabriel. You might know me as a sophomore based in Krak√≥w, Poland.
          I've been coding for over 6 years now. My favourite technologies are
          React and TypeScript. Nevertheless I am also interested in backend,
          that's why my commercial position is Full-stack Software Engineer. I
          like building modern scalable applications that not only work well,
          but also look decent. I love my job and feel extremely satisfied in
          giving people what they need to promote their brand. Don't hesitate to
          contact me if you want to reach something special together!
